# Hangman Game

This Hangman Game is a single player game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game randomly selects a word from one of the three topics: Programming Languages, Chess Players, and Countries. The player has 8 lives to guess the word by selecting letters on the on-screen keyboard. If the player guesses the letter correctly, it will be displayed in the corresponding blank spaces in the word. If the player guesses incorrectly, they will lose a life. The game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of lives. The player can restart the game at any time using the restart button.

## Why I made this game?

I created this game, in jan 2021, as a way to practice and reinforce the basics of JavaScript. 
So the project is quite cool for for beginners. It could be an little application to test your knowledge in javascript, html and CSS.

## How to Play

1. Open the game by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will automatically start, and a random word will be selected from one of the three topics: Programming Languages, Chess Players, and Countries.
3. Use the on-screen keyboard to select letters and guess the word.
4. If the letter is correct, it will be displayed in the corresponding blank space(s) in the word.
5. If the letter is incorrect, you will lose a life. You have 8 lives total.
6. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word or run out of lives.
7. If you guess the word, you win! If you run out of lives, you lose.
8. Click the restart button at any time to start a new game.
